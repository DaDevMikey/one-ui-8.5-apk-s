# One UI 8.5 APK Repository

This repository stores APKs from One UI 8.5 apps (not all of them). These APKs are used by the One UI 8.5 installer module and can also be installed directly from this repository.


# Android 15/One UI 7 WARNING!

if you're on a device running Android 15/One UI 7 most of the apk's are known to crash, apps like personal data intellegence wont install, camera app will crash, and so will the contactsstorage app, do not try to install them unless you know what you're doing! Other apps that could crash are reported by users in our [Telegram](https://t.me/oneui85apks)


# BEFORE YOU START

APK's like the samsung settings app and the one ui home app are NOT included in this repo, because those apps need specific one ui 8.5 libraries and without them the apps WILL crash

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Store One UI 8.5 application APKs
- Allow the installer module to grab APKs directly from here
- Provide direct access to APKs for manual installation

## Installation

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Installing these APKs requires a specific module to work properly** due to certain Android system limitations and compatibility issues.

### Recommended Installation Method

The **easiest way** to install these apps is by using the modules available in the [Releases](../../releases) section:

1. **Installer Module** - Downloads and installs the APKs from this repository
2. ~~**Compatibility Module** - Makes the apps work properly on your device~~
3. **Spoofer Module** if you want features like Live Blur, you need this module, this can break Home Up, but launching activities other then the main activity should still have it work!

~~Both modules are required for the apps to function correctly.~~

As of version 3.0.1-CYK7, the module has ASKS Disabler included, and no longer needs to be installed manually.

### Manual Installation

While you can download and install the APKs directly from this repository (APK's are always released as *PREreleases*, module updates under normal releases), remember that you'll still need the compatibility module (available in module releases) for the apps to work properly.

## Compatibility

These APKs are designed for One UI 8.5 and may not work correctly without the required modules mentioned above, some of the apps also crash on one ui 7, using the module while on android 15/one ui 7 devices is not recommended (currently known crashes include but are not limited to the phone app and the contacts app).
