# One UI 8.5 APK Repository

This repository stores APKs from One UI 8.5 apps (not all of them). These APKs are used by the One UI 8.5 installer module and can also be installed directly from this repository.

# BEFORE YOU START

APK's like the samsung settings app and the one ui home app are NOT included in this repo, because those apps need specific one ui 8.5 libraries and without them the apps WILL crash

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Store One UI 8.5 application APKs
- Allow the installer module to grab APKs directly from here
- Provide direct access to APKs for manual installation

## Installation

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Installing these APKs requires a specific module to work properly** due to certain Android system limitations and compatibility issues.

### Recommended Installation Method

The **easiest way** to install these apps is by using the modules available in the [Releases](../../releases) section:

1. **Installer Module** - Downloads and installs the APKs from this repository
2. **Compatibility Module** - Makes the apps work properly on your device

Both modules are required for the apps to function correctly.

### Manual Installation

While you can download and install the APKs directly from this repository, remember that you'll still need the compatibility module (available in releases) for the apps to work properly.

## Compatibility

These APKs are designed for One UI 8.5 and may not work correctly without the required modules mentioned above.
